## 1) Descriptive Statistics:

- Summary Statistics: Calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range to understand the central tendency and dispersion of data.
- Frequency Distribution: Creating histograms or frequency tables to visualize the distribution of data values.

# 2) Data Profiling:#

- Data Profiling: Examining the basic characteristics of data, including data types, unique values, missing values, and data patterns.

# 3) Data Cleansing:#

- Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers using techniques like the Z-score or the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
- Missing Data Imputation: Filling in missing data points using methods such as mean imputation, median imputation, or predictive modeling.

# 4) Data Validation:#

- Cross-Validation: Checking data integrity by verifying relationships between related fields or tables.
- Referential Integrity: Ensuring that foreign keys in relational databases reference valid primary keys.

# 5) Data Quality Metrics:#

- Data Quality Score: Calculating a composite score based on multiple data quality dimensions (e.g., completeness, accuracy, consistency) to assess overall data quality.
- Error Rate: Quantifying the proportion of data records or entries with errors.

# 6) Data Profiling Tools:#

- Using data profiling tools and software that automate the process of analyzing data to identify anomalies, patterns, and issues.

# 7) Distribution Analysis:#

- Assessing whether data follows specific probability distributions (e.g., normal, binomial) through goodness-of-fit tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Chi-Square test.

# 8) Correlation and Regression:#

- Studying relationships between variables using correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson's correlation coefficient) or regression analysis (e.g., linear regression).

# 9) Sampling Techniques:#

- Conducting random sampling or stratified sampling to assess data quality on a subset of data rather than the entire dataset.

# 10) Data Quality Dashboards:#

- Creating interactive dashboards with visualizations to monitor data quality metrics and trends over time.

# 11) Data Profiling with Machine Learning:#

- Leveraging machine learning algorithms for data profiling tasks, anomaly detection, and predictive data quality assessment.

# 12) Record Linkage and Deduplication:#

- Identifying and merging duplicate records within a dataset, which is important for maintaining data consistency.

# 13) Time Series Analysis:#

- Analyzing data collected over time to detect trends, seasonality, and irregularities.

# 14) Geospatial Analysis:#

- Assessing data quality in geospatial datasets by checking for spatial accuracy, consistency, and completeness.

# 15) Text Analysis:#

- Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess text data quality, including sentiment analysis and text classification.
