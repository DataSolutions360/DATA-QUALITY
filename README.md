**1) Completeness:** 
     - This dimension assesses whether all the required data elements are present and accounted for in the dataset. Incomplete data can lead to gaps in information.
**2) Consistency:** 
     - Consistency ensures that data is uniform and follows the same format, standards, and conventions throughout the dataset. Inconsistent data can lead to confusion and errors.

**3) Timeliness:** 
     - Timeliness reflects how up-to-date the data is. Timely data is relevant and current for its intended use, while outdated data can lead to incorrect decisions.

**4) Accuracy:** 
     - Accuracy measures how closely the data reflects the actual or true values. Accurate data is free from errors and mistakes.

**5) Validity:** 

    - Validity assesses whether the data conforms to predefined rules and constraints, such as data types, formats, and domain-specific business rules.

**6) Lineage:** 

    - Lineage tracks the origin and transformation history of data, ensuring transparency and trust in data sources and transformations.

**7) Increase Activity Level:** 

    - This dimension may refer to data activity or usage, highlighting whether the data is actively maintained, updated, or used within an organization.

**8) Currency:** 

    - Currency relates to the freshness or recency of data, which is important for making informed decisions.

**9) Precision:** 

    - Precision refers to the level of detail or granularity in the data. Precise data provides specific and accurate information.

**10) Accessability:** 

    - Accessibility assesses how easily data can be retrieved, queried, and used by authorized users. Accessible data is crucial for timely decision-making and analysis.

**11) Representation:** 

    - Representation focuses on how data is structured, formatted, and presented. It ensures that data is organized and displayed in a way that is understandable and usable.


























# Techniques of Data Quality

__1) Data Profiling:__  Data profiling involves examining the structure, content, and metadata of your dataset. It helps identify issues such as missing values, data types, and outliers.

__2) Data Cleansing:__  Data cleansing, or data scrubbing, is the process of correcting or removing errors and inconsistencies in your data. This can involve techniques like imputing missing values, correcting data formats, and removing duplicate records.

__3) Data Validation:__ Data validation checks whether the data conforms to predefined rules or constraints. It helps identify data that doesn't meet the expected criteria. For example, you can validate that dates fall within a specific range or that numeric values are within a certain range.

__4) Data Quality Metrics:__ Define and calculate data quality metrics to quantify the level of data quality. Common metrics include completeness (percentage of missing values), accuracy (percentage of errors), and consistency (degree of uniformity).

__5) Data Profiling Tools:__ Use data profiling tools and software to automate the process of examining data attributes, distributions, and patterns. These tools can provide insights into data quality issues.

__6) Data Visualization:__ Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots can help you understand the distribution of data and identify outliers and anomalies.

__7) Statistical Analysis:__ Statistical methods can be applied to detect anomalies and outliers in the data. Techniques like z-scores, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing can be useful.

__8) Data Quality Frameworks:__ Implement data quality frameworks, such as the Data Quality Dimensions framework (completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, validity, etc.), to systematically assess data quality.

__9) Data Sampling:__ When dealing with large datasets, it may be practical to perform data quality analysis on a representative sample rather than the entire dataset. Sampling techniques can help ensure the analysis is manageable.

__10) Data Quality Rules:__ Establish data quality rules and business rules to define the acceptable quality standards for your data. These rules can be used to automate data validation and cleansing processes.

__11) Data Quality Scorecards:__  Create data quality scorecards or dashboards that provide a summary of data quality metrics and issues. This can help stakeholders quickly assess the state of data quality.

__12) User Feedback:__ Solicit feedback from data users and data stewards who work with the data regularly. They may identify issues or discrepancies that automated techniques might miss.

__13) Data Governance:__ Implement a robust data governance framework that includes data quality standards, roles, and responsibilities for maintaining data quality.

__14) Data Quality Audits:__ Conduct periodic data quality audits to ensure that data quality remains high over time. This may involve reevaluating data quality metrics and addressing any new issues that arise.

__15) Root Cause Analysis:__ When data quality issues are identified, perform root cause analysis to determine the underlying causes and implement corrective actions.
